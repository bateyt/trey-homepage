    "text": "Bioarchaeology, Data, and Discovery\nWelcome! I am Trey Batey, a bioarchaeologist specializing in paleodemography—the study of mortality and population structure in past human societies, primarily through skeletal remains. My research focuses on using demographic modeling and advanced statistical techniques to reconstruct life histories and understand how disease, environment, and social change impacted ancient communities.\n\nExpertise and Tools\nMy academic background is rooted in the social sciences (anthropology and sociology), which provides the framework for my research questions. I am an enthusiastic user of the R language and the tidyverse ecosystem for all phases of my work, from data cleaning and statistical modeling to generating complex visualizations and reports.\nI believe in the power of open science and use tools like Quarto (which powers this website) and GitHub to share my projects, code, and findings transparently.\n\n\n\nTeaching\nIn 2015, I joined Lower Columbia College as a full-time instructor. Since then, I’ve taught introductory courses in anthropology and sociology.\n\nANTH& 100–Survey of Anthropology\nANTH& 204–Archaeology\nANTH& 205–Biological Anthropology\nANTH& 206–Cultural Anthropology\nSOC& 101–Introduction to Sociology\n\nFor inquires about my teaching, please contact me at tbatey@lowercolumbia.edu\n\n\nLife and What Not\nWhen I’m not working, you can find me playing my drums, reading a book, spending time with family and friends, or finding a trail with the doggo.\n\nInterested in collaborating? Please visit my Research page or check out my Blog for recent updates."

This plot shows the proportion of individuals surviving to the start of each age interval.\nBelow is an interactive survivorship curve created using the tidyverse and the plotly package. You can hover over the line to see the exact values!"
